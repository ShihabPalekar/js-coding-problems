      You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can
      either be a rectangle or a square. If it is a square, return its area. If
      it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Note: for the purposes of this problem, you will assume that it is a
      square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.
