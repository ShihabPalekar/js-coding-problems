      You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old",
      where x is a random number between 0 and 9.
    </h3>
    <h3>Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.</h3>
    <h3>
      Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the
      test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in
      the string is always a number.
    </h3>
