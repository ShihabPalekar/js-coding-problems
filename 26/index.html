      Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular
      amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get
      aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space
      left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he
      will be able to fit all the passengers.
    </h3>

    <h3>You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
      </li>
      <li>on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.</li>
      <li>
        wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the
        driver.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number
      of passengers he can't take.
    </h3>
