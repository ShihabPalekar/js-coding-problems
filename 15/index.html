    <h3>
      Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in
      biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine
      ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T'). Ribonucleic acid,
      RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from
      DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is
      replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U'). Create a function which
      translates a given DNA string into RNA.
