      The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior
      and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will
      tell prospective members which category they will be placed.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap
      greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the
      better the player the lower the handicap.
    </h3>
    <b>Example:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>input = [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]</li>
      <li>output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]</li>
