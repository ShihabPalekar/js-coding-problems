    <h3>Trolls are attacking your comment section!</h3>
    <h3>
      A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels
      from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new
      string with all vowels removed.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become
      "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
    </h3>
    <h3>Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.</h3>
