    <h3>
      Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num.
      The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function
      only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the
      example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see
      the sample tests.
    </h3>
    <b>Example:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>2 -> 3 (1 + 2)</li>
      <li>8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)</li>
    </ul>
