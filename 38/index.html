    <h3>There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!</h3>
    <h3>
      But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the
      average student in your class.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the
      average and compare your score!
    </h3>
    <h3>Return true if you're better, else false!</h3>
    <h3>
      Note: Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. Do
      not forget them when calculating the average score!
    </h3>

    <b>Example:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>([100, 40, 34, 57, 29, 72, 57, 88], 75) => true</li>
      <li>([12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, 90], 9) => false</li>
    </ul>
