    <h3>
      Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together
      into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to
      sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each
      word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end
      of the sentence!
    </h3>

    <b>Example:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great'] => 'hello world this is great'
      </li>
    </ul>
